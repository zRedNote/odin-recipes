                Cronuts are the doughnuts that make people go nuts! They have the shape and flavor of a doughnut, yet feature the crispy, flaky texture of a buttery croissant.

        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>½ cup warm water (105 degrees F/41 degrees C)</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 pound all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>12 tablespoons European-style (low-moisture) butter at room temperature, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 class="heading">Steps:</h2>

                <p>
                    Place yeast into the mixing bowl of a large stand mixer. 
                    Whisk in warm water and let stand until a creamy foam forms on top, about 5 minutes. 
                    Add milk, sugar, 2 tablespoons melted butter, egg, salt, vanilla extract, and nutmeg. 
                    Whisk mixture thoroughly. Pour flour on top of liquid ingredients. 
                    Place mixing bowl onto mixer.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    Attach dough hook to mixer and knead on low speed until dough comes together in a ball and becomes soft and sticky, about 3 minutes. Dough will stick to the hook and pull away from the side of the bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Transfer dough to a floured work surface, knead 2 or 3 times, and shape into a ball. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes to let gluten relax.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Remove dough from the refrigerator, unwrap, and dust lightly with flour. Roll out into a 9x18-inch rectangle about 1/4-inch thick. Evenly spread 1/2 of the softened butter onto the middle third of the dough. Fold one unbuttered third over the buttered third and press lightly; spread remaining butter on top of that third. Fold remaining third over the first (buttered) third. Transfer dough onto a sheet pan, cover lightly with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel, and refrigerate 20 to 30 more minutes for butter to become firm. Sprinkle dough lightly with flour as you work if it becomes sticky.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    Return dough to floured work surface and pat very gently into an 8x14-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Fold outer thirds over center third as before; roll out into an 8x14-inch rectangle again, keeping the edges as straight as possible. Fold in thirds as before. Cover dough lightly with a kitchen towel, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Roll the dough out to about 3/8 inch thick. Cut dough in half crosswise. Leave half on a lightly floured work surface; refrigerate other half of dough until needed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use a sharp 3-inch round cutter to cut 8 circles of dough from the piece on the work surface. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut the donut holes out of the dough circles.
                </p>
            </li>

                <p>
                    Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and sprinkle lightly with flour. Arrange cronuts and holes onto the prepared baking sheet. Let rise in a draft-free, warm place (such as an unheated oven) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
