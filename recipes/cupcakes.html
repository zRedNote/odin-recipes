            <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>

                    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil liners.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cream together sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with milk; beat well. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before serving or frosting.
